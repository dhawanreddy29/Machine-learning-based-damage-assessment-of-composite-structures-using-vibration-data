# Machine-learning-based-damage-assessment-of-composite-structures-using-vibration-data
Automated assessment can be achieved using this concept, the only requirement is to generate more such reliable data to train and use the model for use cases like aeroplane wing health testing, Chassis health testing,etc. wherever the composite materials is involved. The Vibration testing is reliable NDT method for places where cost is involved in using Scanning inspection method. The vibration method can particularly be used for composite materials maded of carbon fibre and glass fibre. 
Machine learning concept can be used beyond this upto even detecting location of damge is possible, This technique could be expanded to industry level quality inspection.

This is my first integrated project and Bachelor thesis project, Where I was able to achieve:
- Sample design, procurement, damage impartment
- NDT based damage assessment using accelerometer and electrodynamic shaker to identify modal parameters like frequency and mode shapes
- Pre-processing data(Labeling and visualization) generated from DewesoftX
- Selection and implementation of Machine learning algorithm for binary classification
- Trained by formatted experimental data of modal parameters and labeled samples(healthy and unhealthy samples)
- Testing and optimization 
- Damage assessment model generation for achieving non-destructive testing of composite structures
